Data Summary
------------

Downloaded dataset from : https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip

1. Dataset has train, test and validataion samples samples coverting 43 classes (traffic sign classes)
    - Number of train samples = 34799
    - Number of test samples = 12630
    - Number of validation sample = 4410
2. Each train sample is of size 32 x 32 and depth of 3
   - Each sample is converted to gray scale
   - Each sample is normalized to (pixel_value - 128)/128

Design and Test a Model Architechture
=====================================


Preprocessing
-------------

The submission describes the preprocessing techniques used and why these techniques were chosen.

<Ans> MNIST data trained using LeNet is of gray images. Also, the color is not the feature that is used in 
      LeNet classification of MNIST. Based on the same assumption/concept. I used gray images as input train dataset
      Also, normalized such that pixels values are in the range of [-1, 1]. As, curves/edges are the real features from 
      which the network learns. Best way to represent edges/curves intensity is with normalized pixel values
 
 Used train and test split from sklearn (80% train, 20% test)
 Model Architecture
 ------------------
 
 The model architecture used in LeNet and below are the details of it
 
 Input image: 32 x 32 x 1 
 
                              IP          Filter Size  FeatureMap/Depth   Stride  Padding        OP
 Layer1:      Conv1      32 x 32 x 1         5 x 5           6             1       0        28 x 28 x 6
              ReLU       28 x 28 x 6                                                        28 x 28 x 6
              MaxPool    28 x 28 x 6         2 x 2                         2       0        14 x 14 x 6
 Layer2:      Conv2      14 x 14 x 6         5 x 5          16             1       0        10 x 10 x 16
              ReLu       10 x 10 x 16                                                       10 x 10 x 16
              MaxPool    10 x 10 x 16        2 x 2                         2       0         5 x 5 x 16
 Layer3:      Conv3       5 x  5 x 16        5 x 5          400            1       0         1 x 1 x 400
              ReLu        1 x  1 x 400                                                       1 x 1 x 400
 fc1    :     Layer 2 o/p - 5 x 5 x 16   -> output 400
 fc2    :     Layer 3 0/p - 1 x 1 x 400  -> output 400
 
 Output :     FC             800                                                                 43
 
 Model Training
 --------------
 
 Hyper parameters
 ---------------
 EPOCH = 50
 LEARNING RATE = 0.0009
 Mean(Mu) = 0, Stddev(Sigma) = 0.1  (For weight distribution/initialization)
  Dropout = 0.5 (Training)
 
 Others:
 -------
 Activation Function - ReLu
 Optimizer:  Adam
 Loss = CrossEntropy
 Probability of Classification = Softmax
 
 Solution Approach:
 -------------------
 Used predefined LeNet architecture. Tweaking hyper parameters using trial and error method
 Training accuracy: 99.3%
 Test Accuracy: 94.6%
 
 Acquiring New Images:
 ---------------------
 Downloaded from google, samples are in "myimages" project folder
 
 Performance on New Images:
 ---------------------------
 Taken 5 new images of different classes, and classification is 100%
